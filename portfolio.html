    <img src="images/Solar.png" height="250">
    <h1>   For our 1.1.9 project, my partner Khushi and I made Solar Knowledge. It's an interactive program where you can learn about the planets and watch them orbit around the sun. When you first run the program, the planets are still and in a straight line. You are asked ehat planet you would want to learn about. When you input one, it's orbit will highlight green, and give you a fun fact. If you don't want to learn anymore, you can say no, and the planets will start orbiting the sun.
